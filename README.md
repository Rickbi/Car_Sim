# Car Simulation
This is a prototype for a 2D GTA style game, where you can get into a vehicle and drive around the city.

At this point, the driving feels realistic, but it needs a bit of drift as it feels like you are driving a train, which is on rails.

You can also get in and out of any car.

## How to run
To run, install all the dependencies from `requirements.txt`. You can use the following steps.

```pip install -r requirements.txt
py scr```
